Link: https://brew.sh (install this first and then above command)\nInstall Git Link: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git Site Creation\nCreate a new site hugo new site quickstart cd quickstart git init git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke echo \u0026ldquo;theme = \u0026lsquo;ananke\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; \u0026raquo; hugo.toml hugo server\nNote for PaperMod theme follow the instructions here Link: https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/ Demo site: https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/ git submodule add \u0026ndash;depth=1 https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod git submodule update \u0026ndash;init \u0026ndash;recursive # needed when you reclone your repo (submodules may not get cloned automatically)\nNote the Hugo directory structure comes with a default config file \u0026ldquo;hugo.toml\u0026rdquo; However, most of the examples to customize sites are with YAML file. Create a config.yml file and use that as an arguement when building the server hugo \u0026ndash;config config.yml\nAdd the theme to config.yml theme: [\u0026ldquo;PaperMod\u0026rdquo;]\nNext is customization. Easy hack is to copy over the files in /themes/PaperMod/layouts and its subdirectory to your Hugo layout directories Committing changes to GIT\nCreate a GIT repository initialize the branch, setup remote origin, and add all the project to the branch commit all changes push them to the branch Publishing the site\nNote: I used GIT Pages to publish my website so it is accessible through internet. Instead of using GIT Actions, I used GIT Pages with default branch and docs folder setting. build your site without the public folder. Use docs so it matches the GIT Pages setting hugo \u0026ndash;minify \u0026ndash;destination docs \u0026ndash;config config.yml\nThis is eliminate the dependency of public folder commit and push changes again Changes on GIT Repo Settings Goto Pages Under Build \u0026amp; Deployment -\u0026gt; Source = Deploy from Branch select branch folder to match your Hugo site branch where you pushed your changes. In many cases, this will be main select the docs folder Once the project is build by GIT, the GIT Page should be published and available to view.
